                    Deprecating TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1

Abstract

   This document formally deprecates Transport Layer Security (TLS)
   versions 1.0 (RFC 2246) and 1.1 (RFC 4346).  Accordingly, those
   documents have been moved to Historic status.  These versions lack
   support for current and recommended cryptographic algorithms and
   mechanisms, and various government and industry profiles of
   applications using TLS now mandate avoiding these old TLS versions.
   TLS version 1.2 became the recommended version for IETF protocols in
   2008 (subsequently being obsoleted by TLS version 1.3 in 2018),
   providing sufficient time to transition away from older versions.
   Removing support for older versions from implementations reduces the
   attack surface, reduces opportunity for misconfiguration, and
   streamlines library and product maintenance.

   This document also deprecates Datagram TLS (DTLS) version 1.0 (RFC
   4347) but not DTLS version 1.2, and there is no DTLS version 1.1.

   This document updates many RFCs that normatively refer to TLS version
   1.0 or TLS version 1.1, as described herein.  This document also
   updates the best practices for TLS usage in RFC 7525; hence, it is
   part of BCP 195.

1.  Introduction

   Transport Layer Security (TLS) versions 1.0 [RFC2246] and 1.1
   [RFC4346] were superseded by TLS 1.2 [RFC5246] in 2008, which has now
   itself been superseded by TLS 1.3 [RFC8446].  Datagram Transport
   Layer Security (DTLS) version 1.0 [RFC4347] was superseded by DTLS
   1.2 [RFC6347] in 2012.  Therefore, it is timely to further deprecate
   TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, and DTLS 1.0.  Accordingly, the aforementioned
   documents have been moved to Historic status.

   Technical reasons for deprecating these versions include:

   *  They require the implementation of older cipher suites that are no
      longer desirable for cryptographic reasons, e.g., TLS 1.0 makes
      TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA mandatory to implement.
   *  There is a lack of support for current recommended cipher suites,
      especially authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD)
      ciphers, which were not supported prior to TLS 1.2.  Note that
      registry entries for no-longer-desirable ciphersuites remain in
      the registries, but many TLS registries were updated by [RFC8447],
      which indicates that such entries are not recommended by the IETF.
   *  The integrity of the handshake depends on SHA-1 hash.
   *  The authentication of the peers depends on SHA-1 signatures.
   *  Support for four TLS protocol versions increases the likelihood of
      misconfiguration.
   *  At least one widely used library has plans to drop TLS 1.1 and TLS
      1.0 support in upcoming releases; products using such libraries
      would need to use older versions of the libraries to support TLS
      1.0 and TLS 1.1, which is clearly undesirable.

   Deprecation of these versions is intended to assist developers as
   additional justification to no longer support older (D)TLS versions
   and to migrate to a minimum of (D)TLS 1.2.  Deprecation also assists
   product teams with phasing out support for the older versions, to
   reduce the attack surface and the scope of maintenance for protocols
   in their offerings.

1.1.  RFCs Updated

   This document updates the following RFCs that normatively reference
   TLS 1.0, TLS 1.1, or DTLS 1.0.  The update is to obsolete usage of
   these older versions.  Fallback to these versions is prohibited
   through this update.  Specific references to mandatory minimum
   protocol versions of TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 are replaced by TLS 1.2, and
   references to minimum protocol version DTLS 1.0 are replaced by DTLS
   1.2.  Statements that &quot;TLS 1.0 is the most widely deployed version
   and will provide the broadest interoperability&quot; are removed without
   replacement.

   [RFC8422]

   The status of [RFC7562], [RFC6042], [RFC5456], [RFC5024], [RFC4540],
   and [RFC3656] will be updated with permission of the Independent
   Submissions Editor.

   In addition, these RFCs normatively refer to TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1 and
   have already been obsoleted; they are still listed here and marked as
   updated by this document in order to reiterate that any usage of the
   obsolete protocol should use modern TLS: [RFC3316], [RFC3489],
   [RFC3546], [RFC3588], [RFC3734], [RFC3920], [RFC4132], [RFC4244],
   [RFC4347], [RFC4366], [RFC4492], [RFC4507], [RFC4572], [RFC4582],
   [RFC4934], [RFC5077], [RFC5081], [RFC5101], and [RFC5953].

   Note that [RFC4642] has already been updated by [RFC8143], which
   makes an overlapping, but not quite identical, update as this
   document.

   [RFC6614] has a requirement for TLS 1.1 or later, although it only
   makes an informative reference to [RFC4346].  This requirement is
   updated to be for TLS 1.2 or later.

   [RFC6460], [RFC4744], and [RFC4743] are already Historic; they are
   still listed here and marked as updated by this document in order to
   reiterate that any usage of the obsolete protocol should use modern
   TLS.

   This document updates DTLS [RFC6347].  [RFC6347] had allowed for
   negotiating the use of DTLS 1.0, which is now forbidden.

   The DES and International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA) cipher
   suites specified in [RFC5469] were specifically removed from TLS 1.2
   by [RFC5246]; since the only versions of TLS for which their usage is
   defined are now Historic, [RFC5469] has been moved to Historic as
   well.

   The version-fallback Signaling Cipher Suite Value specified in
   [RFC7507] was defined to detect when a given client and server
   negotiate a lower version of (D)TLS than their highest shared
   version.  TLS 1.3 ([RFC8446]) incorporates a different mechanism that
   achieves this purpose, via sentinel values in the ServerHello.Random
   field.  With (D)TLS versions prior to 1.2 fully deprecated, the only
   way for (D)TLS implementations to negotiate a lower version than
   their highest shared version would be to negotiate (D)TLS 1.2 while
   supporting (D)TLS 1.3; supporting (D)TLS 1.3 implies support for the
   ServerHello.Random mechanism.  Accordingly, the functionality from
   [RFC7507] has been superseded, and this document marks it as
   Obsolete.

1.2.  Terminology

   The key words &quot;MUST&quot;, &quot;MUST NOT&quot;, &quot;REQUIRED&quot;, &quot;SHALL&quot;, &quot;SHALL NOT&quot;,
   &quot;SHOULD&quot;, &quot;SHOULD NOT&quot;, &quot;RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;NOT RECOMMENDED&quot;, &quot;MAY&quot;, and
   &quot;OPTIONAL&quot; in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Support for Deprecation

   Specific details on attacks against TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1, as well as
   their mitigations, are provided in [NIST800-52r2], [RFC7457], and
   other RFCs referenced therein.  Although mitigations for the current
   known vulnerabilities have been developed, any future issues
   discovered in old protocol versions might not be mitigated in older
   library versions when newer library versions do not support those old
   protocols.

   For example, NIST has provided the following rationale, copied with
   permission from Section 1.1, &quot;History of TLS&quot;, of [NIST800-52r2]:

   |  TLS 1.1, specified in RFC 4346 [24], was developed to address
   |  weaknesses discovered in TLS 1.0, primarily in the areas of
   |  initialization vector selection and padding error processing.
   |  Initialization vectors were made explicit to prevent a certain
   |  class of attacks on the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of
   |  operation used by TLS.  The handling of padding errors was altered
   |  to treat a padding error as a bad message authentication code
   |  rather than a decryption failure.  In addition, the TLS 1.1 RFC
   |  acknowledges attacks on CBC mode that rely on the time to compute
   |  the message authentication code (MAC).  The TLS 1.1 specification
   |  states that to defend against such attacks, an implementation must
   |  process records in the same manner regardless of whether padding
   |  errors exist.  Further implementation considerations for CBC modes
   |  (which were not included in RFC 4346 [24]) are discussed in
   |  Section 3.3.2.
   |
   |  TLS 1.2, specified in RFC 5246 [25], made several cryptographic
   |  enhancements, particularly in the area of hash functions, with the
   |  ability to use or specify the SHA-2 family of algorithms for hash,
   |  MAC, and Pseudorandom Function (PRF) computations.  TLS 1.2 also
   |  adds authenticated encryption with associated data (AEAD) cipher
   |  suites.
   |
   |  TLS 1.3, specified in RFC 8446 [57], represents a significant
   |  change to TLS that aims to address threats that have arisen over
   |  the years.  Among the changes are a new handshake protocol, a new
   |  key derivation process that uses the HMAC-based Extract-and-Expand
   |  Key Derivation Function (HKDF) [37], and the removal of cipher
   |  suites that use RSA key transport or static Diffie-Hellman ( DH)
   |  [sic] key exchanges, the CBC mode of operation, or SHA-1.  Many
   |  extensions defined for use with TLS 1.2 and previous versions
   |  cannot be used with TLS 1.3.

3.  SHA-1 Usage Problematic in TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1

   The integrity of both TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 depends on a running SHA-1
   hash of the exchanged messages.  This makes it possible to perform a
   downgrade attack on the handshake by an attacker able to perform 2^77
   operations, well below the acceptable modern security margin.

   Similarly, the authentication of the handshake depends on signatures
   made using a SHA-1 hash or a concatenation of MD5 and SHA-1 hashes
   that is not appreciably stronger than a SHA-1 hash, allowing the
   attacker to impersonate a server when it is able to break the
   severely weakened SHA-1 hash.

   Neither TLS 1.0 nor TLS 1.1 allows the peers to select a stronger
   hash for signatures in the ServerKeyExchange or CertificateVerify
   messages, making the only upgrade path the use of a newer protocol
   version.

   See [Bhargavan2016] for additional details.

4.  Do Not Use TLS 1.0

   TLS 1.0 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of TLS 1.0 from any version of
   TLS MUST NOT be permitted.

   Any other version of TLS is more secure than TLS 1.0.  While TLS 1.0
   can be configured to prevent some types of interception, using the
   highest version available is preferred.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,01}.  Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,01}.  Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,01} MUST respond with a &quot;protocol_version&quot; alert
   message and close the connection.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending a ClientHello message.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate TLS 1.0.

5.  Do Not Use TLS 1.1

   TLS 1.1 MUST NOT be used.  Negotiation of TLS 1.1 from any version of
   TLS MUST NOT be permitted.

   Pragmatically, clients MUST NOT send a ClientHello with
   ClientHello.client_version set to {03,02}.  Similarly, servers MUST
   NOT send a ServerHello with ServerHello.server_version set to
   {03,02}.  Any party receiving a Hello message with the protocol
   version set to {03,02} MUST respond with a &quot;protocol_version&quot; alert
   message and close the connection.

   Any newer version of TLS is more secure than TLS 1.1.  While TLS 1.1
   can be configured to prevent some types of interception, using the
   highest version available is preferred.  Support for TLS 1.1 is
   dwindling in libraries and will impact security going forward if
   mitigations for attacks cannot be easily addressed and supported in
   older libraries.

   Historically, TLS specifications were not clear on what the record
   layer version number (TLSPlaintext.version) could contain when
   sending a ClientHello message.  Appendix E of [RFC5246] notes that
   TLSPlaintext.version could be selected to maximize interoperability,
   though no definitive value is identified as ideal.  That guidance is
   still applicable; therefore, TLS servers MUST accept any value
   {03,XX} (including {03,00}) as the record layer version number for
   ClientHello, but they MUST NOT negotiate TLS 1.1.

6.  Updates to RFC 7525

   &quot;Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and
   Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS)&quot; [RFC7525] is BCP 195, which
   is the most recent Best Current Practice for implementing TLS and was
   based on TLS 1.2.  At the time of publication, TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1
   had not yet been deprecated.  As such, BCP 195 is called out
   specifically to update text implementing the deprecation
   recommendations of this document.

   This document updates Section 3.1.1 of [RFC7525] by changing SHOULD
   NOT to MUST NOT as follows:

   *  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.0 [RFC2246].

      Rationale: TLS 1.0 (published in 1999) does not support many
      modern, strong cipher suites.  In addition, TLS 1.0 lacks a per-
      record Initialization Vector (IV) for CBC-based cipher suites and
      does not warn against common padding errors.

   *  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate TLS version 1.1 [RFC4346].

      Rationale: TLS 1.1 (published in 2006) is a security improvement
      over TLS 1.0 but still does not support certain stronger cipher
      suites.

   This document updates Section 3.1.2 of [RFC7525] by changing SHOULD
   NOT to MUST NOT and adding a reference to RFC 6347 as follows:

   *  Implementations MUST NOT negotiate DTLS version 1.0 [RFC4347]
      [RFC6347].

      Version 1.0 of DTLS correlates to version 1.1 of TLS (see above).

7.  Operational Considerations

   This document is part of BCP 195 and, as such, reflects the
   understanding of the IETF (at the time of this document&#x27;s
   publication) as to the best practices for TLS and DTLS usage.

   Though TLS 1.1 has been obsolete since the publication of [RFC5246]
   in 2008, and DTLS 1.0 has been obsolete since the publication of
   [RFC6347] in 2012, there may remain some systems in operation that do
   not support (D)TLS 1.2 or higher.  Adopting the practices recommended
   by this document for any systems that need to communicate with the
   aforementioned class of systems will cause failure to interoperate.
   However, disregarding the recommendations of this document in order
   to continue to interoperate with the aforementioned class of systems
   incurs some amount of risk.  The nature of the risks incurred by
   operating in contravention to the recommendations of this document
   are discussed in Sections 2 and 3, and knowledge of those risks
   should be used along with any potential mitigating factors and the
   risks inherent to updating the systems in question when deciding how
   quickly to adopt the recommendations specified in this document.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document deprecates two older TLS protocol versions and one
   older DTLS protocol version for security reasons already described.
   The attack surface is reduced when there are a smaller number of
   supported protocols and fallback options are removed.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.

<b><i><a href='https://www.rfc-editor.org/errata/eid7103'>EID 7103</a> (Verified) is as follows:</i></b>

<b>Section:</b> GLOBAL

<b>Original Text:</b>

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc%E2%80%8B%204162&quot;
class=&quot;eref&quot;&gt;â 4162&lt;/a&gt;

<b>Corrected Text:</b>

&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc4162&quot;
class=&quot;eref&quot;&gt;â4162&lt;/a&gt;
</pre>
<b>Notes:</b><br/>
(Note: the line wrapping here is mine; the errata tool assumes that this is text, so it won&#x27;t accept long lines.)<br/><br/>The text for this specification is OK, but the HTML rendering has some hard-to-notice errors in the &quot;Updates&quot; field in the metadata block that is being caused by errors in the XML source.<br/><br/>The XML source includes a number of Unicode zero width space characters (U+200B) after commas in the rfc@updates attribute.  xml2rfc is unable to handle these characters correctly, treating them - and the space that follows - as part of the RFC number.  It generates the bad link as you see above.<br/><br/>This can be addressed in xml2rfc, maybe, but this is probably not XML we want to permit.<br/><br/>Paul Wouters (AD): Verified, as this RFC won&#x27;t get any updates.
